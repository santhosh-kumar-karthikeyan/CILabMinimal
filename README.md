# Computational Intelligence Laboratory - Minimal programs

A compilation of python programs involving Computational Intelligence, that are minimal by lines of code at the same time maintaining readability

## Programs present

    - Breadth First Search
    - Depth First Search
    - Uniform Cost Search
    - A* Search
    - KNN Classifier 
    - Decision Tree Classifier
    - Single Layer Perceptron 
    - Ensemble Learning Classifier ( To be implemented )

## Specifications

    - `unwieghted_graph.py` contains a simple graph class sample on how to use the functions in a class for unweighted graph.
    - `weighted_graph.py` contains a similar class on how to use the typical graph search algs in a weighted graph.
    - `decision_tree,.py` contains a decision tree classifer with the ability to both get the root of a decision tree, given the dataset or to build a whole decision tree given the same ( contains both info gain and gini index as impurity measures).
    - `perceptron.py` is a minimal implementation of a single layer perceptron with activation functions, threshold, sigmoid, sign with binary or bipolar sub-activations (whatever they are called) associated with them, being inferred automatically.
    - `knn.py is again a minimal inmplementqtion of a non-parametric knn classifier with euclidean and manhattan distance metrics.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Running the programs

Each algorithm is implemented in its own Python file with a dummy main function that too with enough data to run on its own. To run any program, execute the corresponding file using Python:

``` bash
    python filename.py
```
