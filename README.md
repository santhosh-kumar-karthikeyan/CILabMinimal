# Computational Intelligence Laboratory - Minimal programs

A compilation of python programs involving Computational Intelligence, that are minimal by lines of code at the same time maintaining readability

## Programs present

    - Breadth First Search
    - Depth First Search
    - Uniform Cost Search
    - A* Search
    - KNN Classifier ( To be implemented )
    - Decision Tree Classifier ( To be implemented )
    - Single Layer Perceptron ( To be implemented )
    - Ensemble Learning Classifier ( To be implemented )

## Specifications

    - `graph_main.py` contains a simple graph class sample on how to use the functions in a class ( only for unweighted graph).
    - How to use : sample for weighted graph will be updated soon.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Running the programs

Each algorithm is implemented in its own Python file with a dummy main function that too with enough data to run on its own. To run any program, execute the corresponding file using Python:

``` bash
    python filename.py
```
